          <h2>Stonewall</h2>
          <div class="text">

            <p>A haven for the most marginalized people in the gay community like drag queens, transgender people, male prostitutes, and homeless youth, the Stonewall Inn was the location for one of the most important moments in LGBT history. It was the <em>only</em> public place where gay men could dance with each other.</p>

            <p>While police raids were common in gay bars, owners were often tipped off before the raids would happen. On this particular night, Stonewall employees were not warned.</p>

            <p>Creedence Clearwater Revival's <em>Proud Mary</em> was a popular song at the end of 1969. Later to be covered by Tina Turner, this song became a staple in the gay community. The song continues to be an anthem of pride, as evidenced by this gay man at a wedding who steals the show.</p>

            <p>Martha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera were pivotal players in the riots. Often seen as a white and male moment, the Stonewall Riots were largely instigated by these two trans women of color. Johnson moved to the West Village to escape homophobia back home. On the night of the Stonewall Riots, she was celebrating her 25th birthday. Rivera, 17, went on to be an outspoken critic of racism, sexual violence, and transphobia.</p>

For the LGBT community, who largely still relied on discos to come together in puiblic, music became a strong unifying force.

            <p>Protests continue with the 1987 March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, which includes the first nationwide gathering of bisexuals, in October. Spurred by both Ronald Reagan's lack of acknowledge of the AIDS crisis and the Supreme Court case of <em>Bowers v Hardwick</em>, the march had seven platform points, including an end to racism in the United States and to apartheid in South Africa.</p>
            <p>National Coming Out Day was established a year later in commemoration of the march.</p>

            <p>Although being LGBT was already banned in the army, DADT was passed in 1993 to prevent the armed forces from asking people about their sexual orientation. Originally intended to silence conversations about sexual orientation, DADT came to be seen as an infringement of LGBT equal rights. After all, when you tell LGBT people to be quiet, the opposite often happens.</p>

            <p>The 2000s sees incredibly rapid progress in LGBT rights, with sodomy laws and anti-same-sex marriage laws being struck down around the world while the United States sees fragmentation as states differ on their attitudes and laws about same-sex marriage. Some countries continue to clamp down on LGBT rights, including Uganda and Honduras, both of which ban same-sex marriage in 2005.</p>

            <p>While there is a diversity of attitudes about same-sex marriage even within the LGBT community, same-sex marriage became a crude litmus test of LGBT rights in the United States. The 2000s saw steady move towards the majority of Americans approving of same-sex marriage.</p>

            <p>As we've seen, the LGBT community isn't some monolithic group. Pride often has different meanings depending on their personal experiences. Most recently, there have been several proponents and critics of using a new pride symbol: a rainbow flag with black and brown stripes to signify the importance of people of color within the LGBT community.</p>
            <p><strong>A personal note:</strong> We've seen so much progress over the last few decades and it's easy to forget the struggles that our communities have faced and overcome to give us the privileges that we enjoy today. But it also seems that while things change, we're still faced with the same internal challenges that we faced so many years ago. For me, pride isn't just about proud of being gay; it's a way for me to be thankful to those who came before while having the hope to overcome the challenges that we'll face in the future. Thanks for being a part of it.</p>
